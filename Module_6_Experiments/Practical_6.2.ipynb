    "Whenever we run an experiment, we want to save all relevant data to a \"log file\".\\\n",
    "Making a good log file is a kind of art: you don't want the file to contain unnecessary information, yet, at the same time, you do want the file to include everything you need to make your life as a researcher as easy as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means a good log file does contain some redundancy, as it allows you the flexibility to work with your data in multiple ways.\\\n",
    "On top of that, the redundancy in your log file allows you to double check certain functionalities of your program after the fact.\\\n",
    "*In essence, the purpose of the log file is to save the data you think you might need for your analysis*."

    "\n",
    "- After every trial of your experiment, the relevant data is saved to a data structure. This data structure therefore grows in size after every trial.\n",
    "- All variables necessary for your analyses are saved, like reaction times or accuracy.\n",
    "- At the end of the experiment, this data structure is saved as a file on your computer, often a .csv file (the actual \"log file\") \n",
    "- Inside that log file, every trial is a separate entry (or row), with the same variables present in every trial.\n"

    "The shape of this data structure in Python matters for how the data is saved and accessed during the experiment.\\\n",
    "A popular structure for this data is a list of dictionaries, where each trial is its own dictionary, saved in a list that keeps the trials neatly ordered and easily accessible by their trial number. Other possible structures include, among others, a Numpy array or a Pandas data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the difference in structure may seem irrelevant at first, it has a huge effect on:\n",
    "1. The size of your data structure in your computer memory\n",
    "2. The way you access your data (i.e., can you index or would you access values by keys?)\n",
    "3. The types of variables you are able to save to the data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, you will need to find out what works best for you. While we recommend a list of dictionaries, feel free to pick whatever structure you like and use it for this experiment. "
