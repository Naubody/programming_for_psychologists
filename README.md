This repository contains the course materials for the course "Programming for Psychologists" at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (P_MPROPSY). This 6 EC course is going to teach you your new superpower: Programming in Python!

Over the course of 2 months, you will start thinking like a programmer, and learn how to use Python for experimental design, data analysis, and visualization. You will get to know many essential concepts, data structures, and libraries relevant to research in cognitive neuroscience, and develop a solid foundation for further learning. In addition, you will learn what it means to write and share code in the spirit of Open Science, how to review other people's code, and to ensure your research is reproducible, accessible, and transparent.

## Course structure
The course is organized into 7 modules, each comprising a lecture and two practicals. Each module will focus on a different topic. All lectures and practicals will be in person. Lectures may be recorded.

## Lectures
Lectures will focus on conceptual understanding. You will learn why programming is important for psychologists, what Python is, and how it can support your research. We will further discuss coding best practices and principles of Open Science. Lectures will be held in room MF-A611 every other week on Monday between 3:30-5:15pm.

## Practicals
Practical will focus on skills. You will learn how to write code in Python to perform basic operations, design simple experiments, and analyse and visualize data. Moreover, you will learn how to use the online platform GitHub for version control and publication of your code. Practicals will be held every other week on Monday in room HG-11A22 at 3:00 pm, and Wednesday in room OZW-4A05 at 10am. They will take around 2-2.5h each.

# Home assignment
The main assignment of this course will be writing code for simple data analysis and visualization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. You are going to write this code code in your own time, as well as brief statement about the best practices it follows and how. You will upload this code to an online platform called GitHub, where other students comment on it as part of code review. You will be asked to comment on other student's code as well. More information will follow in November. The home assignment will determine 65% of your grade. 

# Exam: Code review
At the end of the course, you will write an exam in which you will receive code snippets and answer questions about it, as well as conceptual questions about the content of the lectures and practicals. Some of these questions will be open, some others will be multiple choice. More information will follow closer to the date. The outcome of the exam will determine 35% of your grade.

# How to become an expert P(s)ychologist 
This course aims to provide an overview of the many aspects that make a good programmer, focusing on typical workflows of research psychologists using Python. However, learning a new (programming) language takes practice and time, more than this course can offer. To grow beyond the course and become an expert, check out the following resources meant to help you practice at home.

The website "Automate the boring stuffLinks to an external site." is great for beginners, who want to learn the basics in Python.
"The good research handbookLinks to an external site." is for everyone, whether beginner or advanced, describing coding best practices with focus on research.
The "Harvard CS50 courseLinks to an external site." is for those of you looking for a more comprehensive course on Python.
Here is a helpful Python resource paperLinks to an external site. published in eLife for practicing neuroscientist. The corresponding notebooks can be found hereLinks to an external site.. 
All of these resources are free and online.
