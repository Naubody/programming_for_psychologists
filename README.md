**Teaching Assistants:** Anna van Harmelen, Camilla U. Enwereuzor
 


This repository contains the course materials for the course **"Programming for Psychologists"** (P_MPROPSY) at the **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam**. This 6 EC course is going to teach you your new superpower: **Programming in Python!**  

Over the course of 2 months, you will start thinking like a programmer and learn how to use Python for **experimental design, data analysis, and visualization**. You will get to know many **essential concepts, data structures, and libraries** relevant to research in Psychology and Neuroscience, and develop a solid foundation for further learning.

In addition, you will learn what it means to **write and share code** in the spirit of **Open Science**, how to **review other people's code**, and how to ensure your research is **rigorous, reproducible, accessible, and transparent**.

## **Course structure**  
The course is organized into **7 modules**, each comprising a **lecture** (1.5h) and **two practicals** (~2.5h each). Each module will focus on a different topic.

### **Lectures**  
Lectures will focus on **conceptual understanding**. You will learn **why programming is important for psychologists**, what **Python** is, and how it can support your research. We will further discuss **coding best practices** and principles of **Open Science**.  

### **Practicals**  
Practicals will focus on **skills**. You will learn how to **write code in Python** to perform **basic operations, design simple experiments, and analyze and visualize data**. Moreover, you will learn how to use **GitHub** for version control and sharing code.

## **Grading**

### **Home assignment**  
The main assignment of this course will be **writing code for simple data analysis and visualization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data**. You will write this code in your **own time**, along with a **brief statement** about the best practices it follows and how. You will upload this code to **GitHub**, where **other students will comment on it** as part of a **code review**. You will also be asked to review other students' code. Find more information about the home assignment [here](https://github.com/Naubody/programming_for_psychologists/blob/main/Home_assignment/Home_assignment.pdf).

**The home assignment will determine 25% of your grade.**

---

### **Exam**  
At the end of the course, you will take an **exam**, where you will:  
- Receive **code snippets** and answer questions about them  
- Answer **conceptual questions** based on lecture and practical content  
- Solve a mix of **open-ended and multiple-choice questions**

**The outcome of the exam will determine 50% of your grade.**

---

### **Quizzes**  
Each module will come with a quiz containing multiple-choice and multiple-answer questions about the week’s lecture and practicals.

**The outcome of the quizzes will determine 25% of your grade.**
