# Programming for Psychologists 2024  

**Course coordinator:** Matthias Nau  
**Teaching Assistant:** Anna van Harmelen  
**Contact:** [m.nau@vu.nl](mailto:m.nau@vu.nl)  

This repository contains the course materials for the course **"Programming for Psychologists"** at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (**P_MPROPSY**). This **6 EC** course is going to teach you your new superpower: **Programming in Python!**  

Over the course of **2 months**, you will start thinking like a programmer and learn how to use Python for **experimental design, data analysis, and visualization**. You will get to know many essential **concepts, data structures, and libraries** relevant to research in **cognitive neuroscience**, and develop a solid foundation for further learning.  

In addition, you will learn what it means to **write and share code** in the spirit of **Open Science**, how to **review other people's code**, and how to ensure your research is **reproducible, accessible, and transparent**.

## **Course structure**  
The course is organized into **7 modules**, each comprising a **lecture and two practicals**. Each module will focus on a different topic. All lectures and practicals will be **in person**. Lectures may be recorded.  

## **Lectures**  
Lectures will focus on **conceptual understanding**. You will learn **why programming is important for psychologists**, what **Python** is, and how it can support your research. We will further discuss **coding best practices** and principles of **Open Science**.  

**Location:** Room MF-A611  
**Schedule:** Every other Monday, 3:30-5:15 PM  

## **Practicals**  
Practicals will focus on **skills**. You will learn how to **write code in Python** to perform **basic operations, design simple experiments, and analyze and visualize data**. Moreover, you will learn how to use **GitHub** for version control and sharing your code.  

**Location & Schedule:**  
- **Monday:** Room HG-11A22, 3:00 PM  
- **Wednesday:** Room OZW-4A05, 10:00 AM

## **Home assignment**  
The main assignment of this course will be **writing code for simple data analysis and visualization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data**.  

You will write this code in your **own time**, along with a **brief statement** about the best practices it follows and how. You will upload this code to **GitHub**, where **other students will comment on it** as part of a **code review**. You will also be asked to review other students' code.  

More information will follow in **November**.  

**The home assignment will determine 65% of your grade.**  

---

## **Exam: Code review**  
At the end of the course, you will take an **exam**, where you will:  
- Receive **code snippets** and answer questions about them  
- Answer **conceptual questions** based on lecture and practical content  
- Solve a mix of **open-ended and multiple-choice questions**  

**The outcome of the exam will determine 35% of your grade.**

## **How to become an expert P(s)ychologist**  
This course aims to provide an **overview** of the many aspects that make a **good programmer**, focusing on **typical workflows of research psychologists using Python**.  

However, learning a new (programming) language takes **practice and time**, more than this course can offer. To **grow beyond the course** and become an expert, check out the following **resources** meant to help you **practice at home**:  

- **[Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)** – Great for beginners who want to learn Python basics.  
- **[The Good Research Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/)** – Covers coding best practices with a focus on research.  
- **[Harvard CS50 Python Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/)** – A more comprehensive Python course.  
- **[Python for Neuroscientists (eLife)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53222)** – A useful resource for practicing neuroscientists.  

All of these resources are **free and online**.
